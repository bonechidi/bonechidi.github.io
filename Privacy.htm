      party that provides automated fraud detection services to us. We also occasionally collect information that
      is made publicly available on social media websites. You can control how much of your information social

      as hosting and maintaining our servers and our service, database storage and management, e-mail
      management, storage marketing, credit card processing, customer service and fulfilling orders for products
      and services you may purchase through our service. We will likely share your personal information, and

      your participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other
      unsubscribe option that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have
      authorized us to contact them, either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited
      commercial emails, because we hate spam as much as you do. By submitting your email address, you also
      agree to allow us to use your email address for customer audience targeting on sites like Facebook, where
      we display custom advertising to specific people who have opted-in to receive communications from us.
      Email addresses submitted only through the order processing page will be used for the sole purpose of
      sending you information and updates pertaining to your order. If, however, you have provided the same
      email to us through another method, we may use it for any of the purposes stated in this Policy. Note: If at
      any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe
      instructions at the bottom of each email.
      <h2>Could my information be transferred to other
      countries?</h2>
      We are incorporated in nigeria. Information collected via our website, through direct interactions with you,
      or from use of our help services may be transferred from time to time to our offices or personnel, or to
      third parties, located throughout the world, and may be viewed and hosted anywhere in the world,
      including countries that may not have laws of general applicability regulating the use and transfer of such
      data. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, by using any of the above, you voluntarily consent to
      the trans- border transfer and hosting of such information.
      <h2>Is the information collected through our service
      secure?</h2>
      We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and
      managerial procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
      correctly use your information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including
      encryption systems. In addition, people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow
      policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot
      guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes any non-disclaimable duty to protect your
      personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the standards used to measure our
      compliance with that duty.
      <h2>Can I update or correct my information?</h2>
      
      The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information we collect depend on your
      relationship with us. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company
      employment policies. Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of
      personally identifiable information as follows. You can contact us in order to <h3>(1) update or correct your
      personally identifiable information, <br>(2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other
      information you receive from us, or<br> (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about
      you on our systems (subject to the following paragraph), by cancelling your account. <br></h3>
     
      Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on other information that we maintain, or
      information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such
      update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may take reasonable steps
      (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before granting you profile access or
      making corrections. You are responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique password and account
      information at all times. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and
      every record of the information you have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our
      systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your information may exist in a
      non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. Promptly after receiving your
      request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and other readily searchable media
      will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the extent reasonably and
      technically practicable. If you are an end user and wish to update, delete, or receive any information we
      have about you, you may do so by contacting the organization of which you are a customer.
      <h2>Personnel</h2>
      If you are one of our workers or applicants, we collect information you voluntarily provide to us. We use
      the information collected for Human Resources purposes in order to administer benefits to workers and
      screen applicants. You may contact us in order to <h3>(1) update or correct your information,<br> (2) change your
      preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us, or <br>(3) receive a
      record of the information we have relating to you.<br></h3> Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will
      have no effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties
      in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion.
      <h2>Sale of Business</h2>
      We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other transfer
      of all or substantially all of the assets of us or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that
      portion of us or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we
      discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization
      or similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.
      <h2>Affiliates</h2>
      We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For
      purposes of this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or
      indirectly controls, is controlled by or is under common control with us, whether by ownership or
      otherwise. Any information relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by
      those Corporate Affiliates in accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.
      <h2>How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
      We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide service to you and fulfill the purposes
      described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who
      carries out services on our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need
      for us to keep it to comply with our legal or regulatory obligations, we'll either remove it from our systems
      or depersonalize it so that we can't identify you.
     <h2> How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>
      We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when
      you place an order or enter, submit, or access your personal information. We offer the use of a secure
      server. All supplied sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer (SSL) technology
      and then encrypted into our Payment gateway providers database only to be accessible by those authorized
      with special access rights to such systems, and are required to keep the information confidential. After a
      transaction, your private information (credit cards, social security numbers, financials, etc.) is never kept
      on file. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to us
      or guarantee that your information on the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by
      a breach of any of our physical, technical, or managerial safeguards.
     <h2> Governing Law</h2>
      The laws of nigeria, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Agreement and your use of our
      service. Your use of our service may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.
      <h2>Your Consent</h2>
      By using our service, registering an account, or making a purchase, you consent to this Privacy Policy.
      <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
      
      This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not
      operated or controlled by us. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in
      such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness
      by us. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy
      Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that
      have a link on our platform, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Such third parties may use
      their own cookies or other methods to collect information about you.
      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      We use "Cookies" to identify the areas of our website that you have visited. A Cookie is a small piece of
      data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser. We use Cookies to personalize the
      Content that you see on our website. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of Cookies.
      However, if you disable Cookies, you may not be able to access functionality on our website correctly or
      at all. We never place Personally Identifiable Information in Cookies.
      <h2>Advertising</h2>
      Advertising keeps us and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to make
      sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible.
      <h2>Cookies for Advertising</h2>
      Cookies help to make advertising more effective. Without cookies, it's really hard for an advertiser to
      reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.
     <h2> Remarketing Services</h2>
      We use remarketing services. What Is Remarketing? In digital marketing, remarketing (or retargeting) is
      the practice of serving ads across the internet to people who have already visited your website. It allows
      your company to seem like they're “following” people around the internet by serving ads on the websites
      and platforms they use most.
      <h2>Payment Details</h2>
      In respect to any credit card or other payment processing details you have provided us, we commit that
      this confidential information will be stored in the most secure manner possible.
      <h2>Kids' Privacy</h2>
      We collect information from kids under the age of 13 just to better our services. If You are a parent or
      guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data without your permission,
      please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age
      of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from our servers.
      <h2>Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h2>
      If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those changes on this page, and/or update the
      Privacy Policy modification date below.
      <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
      We may display, include or make available third-party content (including data, information, applications
      and other products services) or provide links to third-party websites or services ("Third- Party Services").
      You acknowledge and agree that we shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their
      accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other
      aspect thereof. We do not assume and shall not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other
      person or entity for any Third-Party Services.
      Third-Party Services and links thereto are provided solely as a convenience to you and you access and use
      them entirely at your own risk and subject to such third parties' terms and conditions.
      <h2>Tracking Technologies</h2>
      <h3>• Google Maps APIs</h3>
      Google Maps API is a robust tool that can be used to create a custom map, a searchable map, check-in
      functions, display live data synching with location, plan routes, or create a mashup just to name a few.
      Google Maps API may collect information from You and from Your Device for security purposes.
      Google Maps API collects information that is held in accordance with its Privacy Policy.
      <h3>• Cookies</h3>
      
      We use Cookies to enhance the performance and functionality of our service but are non-essential to their
      use. However, without these cookies, certain functionality like videos may become unavailable or you
      would be required to enter your login details every time you visit our service as we would not be able to
      remember that you had logged in previously.
      <h1>Information about General Data Protection
      Regulation (GDPR)</h1>
      We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area
      (EEA), and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data
      collected, and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.
      <h2>What is GDPR?</h2>
      GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by
      companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.
      <h2>What is personal data?</h2>
      Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of
      information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a
      person. Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial
      information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual
      orientation, and ethnicity. The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:
      <h3>• Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be
      used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.<br>
      • Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that
      purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.<br>
      • Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.<br>
      • People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request
      a copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another
      organization.<br></h3>
      <h2>Why is GDPR important?</h2>
      GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data
      that they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and
      imposing greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Help Scout we
      strongly believe that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy
      practices in place that go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.
      <h2>Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access,
      Portability and Deletion</h2>
      We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. processes
      or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and
      personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in
      accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.
      We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the
      ability to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We've been set up as self service
      from the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customer
      support team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.

      the third parties with whom we share it, which we have explained above.
